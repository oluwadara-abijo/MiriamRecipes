# MiriamsRecipes

## Project Overview
This is the third of my projects for the Android Developer Nanodegree with Udacity.

Miriam's Recipes is an Android application which displays baking recipes from Miriam - Udacity's resident baker-in-chief.
Users can select a recipe, and see a list of ingredients used, as well as video-guided steps for how to complete it.
The app also has a companion widget.

## Getting started
To build the project, you can clone the repository, and use the "Import Project" option in Android Studio.

## Libraries Used
Espresso - For UI tests.

Butterknife - For data binding

Exoplayer - For playing media
